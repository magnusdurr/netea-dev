Changes from 1.1 to 1.2
=======================
* Points and stats aligned with approved Codex Astartes
* Introduced Core/Support structure
* Removed all Air Transports!
* Character (and Venerable Dreadnought) upgrades cleaned up to avoid multiple Leader or Inspiring characters in one formation.
  - Veteran Sargents (cheap leader) only available in core formations.
  - Venerable Dreadnoughts are now the only option to get Inspiring or Supreme Commander.
  - New Techmarine character, unlocks Graviton Guns on selected units in his formation.
* Iron Hands Clan split into two formations: Dreadnought and Mechanized Clan to give each formation a clear role and to enable a combined arms formation to a reasonable price. Devastators are now a formation upgrade.
  - Added Land Raider Anvilarum as an option to transport Dreadnoughts
* Assault Marines replaced by Land Speeders, as they fit the ground based play style better
* Dreadnought Talon points increase to avoid spam, and an additional +25 points upgrade to deploy in Drop Pod
* Changed Iron Hands Strike Cruiser transport capability to limit number of dropping Dreadnoughts
* Introduced a few new Titan configurations and aligned most weapon stats with Titan Legion to make large Titans more attractive despite the "Cult of the Machine" special rule
* Removed the "Flesh is Weak" special rule
And a few more small changes...
